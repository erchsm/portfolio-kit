      <h3>When was the last time you made someone's day?</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of ProtoHack, a codefree hackathon, each team gave they're pitches for what they wanted to build. My friend Sarah posed the above prompt in her initial pitch for the idea of GivJoy during this pitch. This question really resonated with me and I decided to join their team and help them solve their problem.</p>

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>Going into ProtoHack I had no idea what to expect. As a developer, the idea of a strictly <strong>no coding</strong> hackthon seemed backwards to me. If there's been something I've learned about the design world it's that designers get passionate about their designs–I was fearful of how this would come into play in this space.</p>
      <p>&horbar;To say the least I was <strong>anxious</strong> about what the day would bring. The turnout of ProtoHack mostly consisted of buisiness development professionals, UX designers and marketers. They gave us the morning of ProtoHack to build teams and comes up with ideas for a product.</p>
